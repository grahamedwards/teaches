# GrahamEdwards/teaches-climate

This repository holds Graham's collected lecture slides for his climate sciene/history/change course, written in [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) (see directory `revealjs/`).

While I have made this a public and open repository, please be considerate of my intellectual work. If you would like to use any of this material or have any questions, please reach out to me at gedward1 [at] trinty.edu. Thanks! ~ghe
